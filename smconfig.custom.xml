<!-- This file can be used as a basis for creating your own 
     smconfig.custom.xml file:
		 1. copy this file to smconfig.custom.xml
		 2. create definitions for modifications (<mod> elements)
		    and homology search mode mappings (<homology>)

 Definitions in smconfig.custom.xml will override any
 definitions in smconfig.std.xml. Spectrum Mill automatically
 combines the smconfig.custom.xml file and the smconfig.std.xml
 file to produce the smconfig.xml that is used by the programs.

 !! The smconfig.std.xml file should not be modified! !!

 The smconfig.misc.xml file contains various modification 
 definitions which may be copy and pasted into your
 smconfig.custom.xml file. 

 Please see the smconfig.custom.example.xml file for an
 example of how a smconfig.custom.xml might look.

 Note that the smconfig.custom.xml file will not be overwritten
 during a re-install of Spectrum Mill.

 Please see the Spectrum Mill Installation and Configuration 
 guide for details.
